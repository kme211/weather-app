# weather-app

Simple weather app created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

I use canvas to create rain/snow/sun particle(s). You can see a demo I made on [Codepen](https://codepen.io/kme211/pen/XpeqjG).

The [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/) is used to retrieve the weather info.
